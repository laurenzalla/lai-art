**Mapping Medicaid Prescription Drug Coverage of Long-Acting Injectable Antiretroviral Therapy (LAI-ART) for HIV**

As of October 2024, two forms of LAI-ART are available in the United States: cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV; brand name: Cabenuva) and lenacapivir (LEN; brand name: Sunlenca). CAB/RPV is delivered by intramuscular injection every one or two months. CAB/RPV was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 21, 2021 for use in adults who have achieved viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL). On September 12, 2024, guidelines were updated (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/) to recommend the use of CAB/RPV in select individuals with persistent virologic failure on daily oral ART. LEN is delivered by subcutaneous injection once every six months in combination with an optimized daily oral background regimen; it was approved on December 22, 2022 for use in adults with multi-drug-resistant HIV.

Data on Medicaid prescription drug coverage of CAB/RPV and LEN were abstracted from state Medicaid program formularies between May-August 2024. Formulary data were merged with state Medicaid program characteristics published by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Data abstraction was performed by Sita Lujintanon in May-August 2024 and validated by Lauren Zalla on August 27, 2024.

**State Medicaid Program Characteristics**
- Adoption and implementation of Medicaid expansion (Y/N) as of May 8, 2024	[Source: Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/)].
- Use of managed care organizations (MCOs) (Y/N) as of August 27, 2024	[Source: 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation survey of state Medicaid program officials (https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/mapping-medicaid-managed-care-models-delivery-system-and-payment-reform/) updated based on review of state Medicaid program websites in August 2024].
- Pharmacy benefit carved out from MCO contracts (Y/N) as of July 1, 2019	[Source: Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/medicaid-preferred-drug-lists/)].
- ARVs carved out from MCO contracts (Y/N) as of July 1, 2019	[Source: Kaiser Family Foundation (https://www.kff.org/hivaids/issue-brief/state-medicaid-management-of-prescription-drugs-for-hiv-treatment-and-prevention/)].
- Use of statewide uniform PDL (Y/N)	as of August 27, 2024 [Source: 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation survey of state Medicaid program officials (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/medicaid-preferred-drug-lists/) updated based on review of state Medicaid program websites in August 2024].
- ARVs included on statewide uniform PDL (Y/N) as of August 27, 2024 [Source:	Review of state Medicaid program PDLs in August 2024].

Based on state Medicaid program characteristics, we determined whether ARVs were covered uniformly across FFS Medicaid and Medicaid MCOs (Y/N), classified as “Y” unless all of the following criteria were met: (1) the state uses MCOs, (2) the pharmacy benefit is not carved out completely from MCO contracts, (3) ARVs are not specifically carved out from MCO contracts, and (4) the state does not use a statewide uniform PDL that includes ARVs.

Finally, we determined state Medicaid program coverage of CAB/RPV and LEN based on state Medicaid program characteristics and formulary data abstracted from state Medicaid drug lookup web pages and PDLs.

**Coverage Determination**
- _Uniform Access_:	Appears on state PDL with designation as Preferred and state does not require PA; _OR_ Appears on state PDL without designation as Preferred or Non-Preferred but state explicitly does not require PA; _OR_ Excluded from state PDL but state explicitly does not require PA.
- _Non-Uniform Access_:	Meets criteria for Uniform Access, but coverage is not uniform across FFS Medicaid and MCOs; _AND_ The medication is not covered or PA is required by at least one MCO, or no information is available about coverage by MCOs.
- _Limited Access_:	Appears on state PDL with designation as Non-Preferred; _OR_ State explicitly requires PA; _OR_ Does not appear on PDL or drug lookup and is likely to only be covered through medical billing.
- _Missing_:	No current PDL, drug lookup web page, or other information available on coverage by FFS Medicaid.

In the data file (lai-art_medicaid_11oct24.xlsx), Table 1 contains one row per state and Table 2 contains one row per MCO for those states that do not have uniform coverage of ARVs across FFS Medicaid and MCOs.
